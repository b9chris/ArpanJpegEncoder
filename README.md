#Arpan Jpeg Encoder

A github repository for code originally posted to CodeProject:

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/83225/A-Simple-JPEG-Encoder-in-C

Which itself is a translation of a C project "from a forum" - where is not stated.

The version here simplifies the main encoder call a bit so you can skip implementing the 2 interfaces for handling progress updates (for example if you're running this on a server, or just want to keep the call simple).

The code is under the Code Project License:

Although the original C code may have been under a different license - unknown.
